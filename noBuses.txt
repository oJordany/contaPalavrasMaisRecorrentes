Lady, Where's your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer it when there's
Loads of love around
But when your short of some
It's nowhere to be found
Well I know your game
You told him yesterday
No chance you'll get nothing from me
But now she's there, you're there and
Everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be
Just like me
Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh and she's thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?
Lady, where has your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand
Must be first be in demand
How he longs for you to
Long for him once more
Just once more
Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just coz' everybodys doing it
Does that mean that i can too?
Ohh, her eyes went down
And cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want
Or the one you lost
An ache in your soul
Is everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her
And that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing
And don't realize that it won't change a thing
Realize it won't change a thing.
